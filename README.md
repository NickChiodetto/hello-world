I am an electromagnetic designer. PhD student in SPM high speed machines. I use finite elemets softwares on a daily basis, but I'm trying to develop my own one. I'm pretty strong in matlab programming, got some training in Fortran and also C++, but I would like to become a good programmer with Python, as it is open source.
